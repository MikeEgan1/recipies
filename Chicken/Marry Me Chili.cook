    Season the @chicken breasts{2} with @salt{1/2%tsp} and @black pepper{1/2%tsp}.
    Heat 2 @olive oil{2%tbsp} in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook for about 5 minutes per side. Set the chicken on a plate.
    Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the Dutch oven along with the @white onion{1} and @garlic{4%cloves} and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is slightly softened, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the @corn kernals{1%cup} and cook just to heat through, about 1 minute for frozen or 30 seconds for canned. Add the @diced fire-roasted tomatoes with green chilis{20%oz}, @chicken broth{2%cups}, chicken, @black beans{15%oz}, @green chiles{4 1/2%oz}, @chili powder{2%tsp}, @cumin{1%tsp}, @oregano{1%tsp}, @paprika{1%tsp}, @salt{1%tsp}, and a few twists of pepper and stir to combine.
    Add the @cream cheese{6%oz} pieces to the pot and stir to combine. Increase the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.
    Remove the chicken from the pot, shred or slice it, then return back to the pot. Stir in the @kale{2%cups}, taste for salt and heat, and adjust to your taste. Add more chicken broth if you prefer a thinner chili.
    Serve in a big pot with bowls and all the toppings.
